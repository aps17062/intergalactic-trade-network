Monitoring and Logging Service
2. High-Level Architecture Diagram
Imagine the following structure for a robust, scalable, and resilient system:
API Gateway:
Acts as the entry point for all external requests.
Handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing to appropriate microservices.
Microservices:
Each core service is designed as a microservice to ensure modularity, scalability, and ease of deployment.
Trade Service:
Responsibilities:
Handles trade transactions.
Manages the lifecycle of a trade (initiating, updating, completing).
Endpoints:
POST /api/trades
GET /api/trades/{transactionId}
Data Flow:
Interacts with Inventory Service to update stock levels.
Interacts with Cargo Management Service to manage shipments related to the trade.
Database: Stores trade-related data.
Cargo Management Service:
Responsibilities:
Manages cargo shipments, including creation, tracking, and delivery status.
Endpoints:
POST /api/cargo
GET /api/cargo/{shipmentId}
Data Flow:
Retrieves and updates shipment details from the database.
Sends event notifications to the Event Processing Pipeline.
Database: Stores cargo-related data.
Inventory Service:
Responsibilities:
Tracks inventory levels at space stations and planets.
Endpoints:
GET /api/inventory/{stationId}
PUT /api/inventory/{stationId}/items
Data Flow:
Updates inventory based on trades and cargo movements.
Provides inventory status to the Real-Time Analytics Service.
Database: Stores inventory levels and related metadata.
Database Layer:
Primary Database (SQL/NoSQL):
Stores structured data for trades, cargo, and inventory.
Supports ACID transactions for consistency.
Time-Series Database:
Stores events and metrics for real-time analytics.
Optimized for high-throughput and efficient querying.
Event Processing Pipeline:
Responsibilities:
Ingests events from various services (e.g., trade completion, cargo updates).
Processes events in real-time and triggers corresponding actions (e.g., notifications, updates to other services).
Technologies:
Message Broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ): Manages event distribution.
Stream Processing (Apache Flink/Apache Spark): Processes events in real-time.
Event Store (Cassandra/DynamoDB): Stores processed events for auditing and analytics.
Real-Time Analytics Service:
Responsibilities:
Aggregates data from all services.
Provides real-time dashboards and alerts for trade activities, cargo status, and inventory levels.
Technologies:
Dashboard (Grafana/Kibana): Visualizes metrics and alerts.
Analytics Engine (Elasticsearch): Queries and indexes data for quick retrieval.
Authentication and Authorization Service:
Responsibilities:
Manages user authentication (OAuth2.0, JWT tokens).
Implements role-based access control (RBAC) for different services.
Technologies:
Identity Provider (Auth0/Okta): Manages user identities.
API Gateway: Handles token validation and user permissions.
Monitoring and Logging Service:
Responsibilities:
Monitors system health, performance metrics, and error rates.
Centralized logging for troubleshooting and auditing.
Technologies:
Monitoring (Prometheus/Datadog): Tracks performance and alerts.
Logging (ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Manages and visualizes logs.
3. Data Flow and Interactions
Trade Execution:
A trade is initiated via the API Gateway and routed to the Trade Service.
The Trade Service validates the trade, updates the Inventory Service, and records the transaction.
If the trade involves cargo, the Cargo Management Service is notified to arrange shipment.
Cargo Management:
The Cargo Management Service creates a shipment and updates its status.
Shipment events are sent to the Event Processing Pipeline for real-time updates.
The Inventory Service updates inventory based on shipment movements.
Inventory Tracking:
The Inventory Service keeps real-time track of stock levels at different stations.
It provides data to the Real-Time Analytics Service for dashboards and alerts.
Real-Time Analytics:
The Real-Time Analytics Service aggregates data from the Event Processing Pipeline and other services.
Dashboards display key metrics like trade volume, cargo status, and inventory levels.
4. Technology Stack
Programming Languages:
Java/Spring Boot: For backend microservices.
Python: For event processing and analytics tasks.
Databases:
PostgreSQL/MySQL: For primary relational data storage.
MongoDB/Cassandra: For distributed and unstructured data storage.
Elasticsearch: For fast search and analytics queries.
Event Processing:
Kafka: For message brokering and event distribution.
Apache Flink: For real-time stream processing.
Monitoring and Logging:
Prometheus: For metrics collection and alerting.
ELK Stack: For centralized logging and monitoring.
API Gateway:
Kong/NGINX: For API management, routing, and security.
Authentication:
OAuth2.0/JWT: For secure authentication and authorization.
5. Scaling and Fault Tolerance
Horizontal Scaling:
Microservices can be independently scaled based on load, ensuring that no single service becomes a bottleneck.
Load Balancing:
Use of load balancers at both the API Gateway and service level to distribute traffic evenly.
Auto-recovery:
Services are designed to automatically restart in case of failures, with minimal impact on overall system functionality.
Redundancy:
Data is replicated across multiple nodes/databases to ensure high availability.
6. Security Considerations
Data Encryption:
Use SSL/TLS for data in transit and AES-256 for data at rest.
Access Control:
Implement RBAC at the API Gateway level to restrict access to services.
Audit Logging:
Maintain logs of all transactions, events, and user actions for auditing and compliance.
7. Deployment Strategy
Containerization:
Use Docker for containerizing microservices, ensuring consistency across environments.
Orchestration:
Kubernetes for container orchestration, allowing easy management of scaling, deployment, and rollbacks.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Jenkins/CircleCI pipelines for automated testing and deployment to production.
This system design ensures that the intergalactic trade network backend is scalable, resilient, and capable of handling the demands of an interplanetary trade system. It leverages modern technologies and best practices to provide real-time updates, efficient data processing, and secure transactions across multiple planets and space stations.
